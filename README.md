A sucesor to the original Corre Vejigante infinite runner, but with a new and improved board mechanic, and other new additions. 
Runs on Unreal Engine 4.20 and above. 

PRE-ALPHA VERSION
Working on: aesthetics and obstacles

Fixed: 
-Board moves under the character; random spawning walls solved.
-Tostones spawn in lanes instead of all over the tile; vejigante also moves in lanes.
-Walls no longer cause death.
-Obstacles spawn in lanes where tostones are not placed.
-New Water tile.
-New couple, unlock and big block tile.
-Bug fixes.
-Tile spawns are gradual.
